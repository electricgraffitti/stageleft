 ======================================


Stage Left Redesign was born from the natural creativity of Cristina Le Breton and has blossomed into an art form all its own. Cristina knew she had an eye for displays and staging at the age of 15 while working at a well known store in Rome, Italy. The Hilton Boutique was her canvas from age 18 to 23 which launched a great many jobs in management and sales for retail stores in places like Australia and Las Vegas, Nevada. She owned her own clothing stores, Wrongdaddy's, that opened in 1973 in Las Vegas and Boulder City, Nevada along with many other entrepreneurial endeavors over the last 45 years.

In 1981 she became a realtor and then a broker in 1993 owning her own real estate company. While she worked in real estate she opened a gift shop on the side called Cristina's Treasures in 1986 and found a passion for displays again while making and selling her own creative cards and wrapping while still working in real estate.

Cristina has a total of 28 years in real estate sales, 45 years in retail and displays, and has been self employed for 35 years. She is now currently certified with CIRS, CISS, IAI and IRIS (Interior Redesign Industry Specialist) for staging and redesign. She has remodeled a total of 20+ homes throughout Boulder City and Las Vegas, Nevada and parts of Arizona and Australia.

Stage Left Redesign is currently holding CIRS, CISS Designation, certification by IAI (Interior Arrangement Industry), a member of IRIS (Interior Redesign Industry Specialist) and also a part of RESA (Real Estate Staging Association).

In an exciting real estate market, Cristina's talents and passions are just what you need to sell a home, make your home more comfortable, increase sales at your store, shop for the right items or show off your holiday decorations and more. Contact Cristina now for a consultation at

It can de-clutter any area and make a stunning scene for potential buyers. Staging also helps to sell your home quicker and for more money. With little or no money you can exit your home in style!
