	<h2>About Us</h2>
	<p>
		Our Company was born from the natural creativity of Cristina Le Breton and has blossomed into an art form all its own. Cristina knew she had an eye for displays and staging at the age of 15 while working at a well known store in Rome, Italy. The Hilton Boutique was her canvas from age 18 to 23 which launched a great many jobs in management and sales for retail stores in places like Australia and Las Vegas, Nevada. She owned her own clothing stores, Wrongdaddy's, that opened in 1973 in Las Vegas and Boulder City, Nevada along with many other entrepreneurial endeavors over the last 45 years.

	<p>
		In 1981 she became a realtor and then a broker in 1993 owning her own real estate company. While she worked in real estate she opened a gift shop on the side called Cristina's Treasures in 1986 and found a passion for displays again while making and selling her own creative cards and wrapping while still working in real estate.
