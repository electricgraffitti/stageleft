	 		Dear Cristina,<br />
	I know I am not easy to get along with, and I thank you for being so gracious.
	Thank you for helping with the staging of our house.  You made it so lovely to show.  I could not believe the praising of the clients.  I wish I had called you earlier, maybe the house would have sold sooner.<br />
	<br />
	Thank you again,<br />
	Sincerely yours,<br />

			Dear Cristina,<br />
			Thank you so much for the beautiful job you did on 641 Mt. Bona.  My neighbors did not even recognize the place!  You made the flow of the home so comfortable, the art work showed so much better, you have a gift.  I will recommend you to my friends and neighbors, whether they are selling or just need a little "help" with decor.<br />
			P.S.  The Priced was right too!!!<br />

			Dear Cristina,<br />
			I want to thank you so much for the fabulous job you did on Mt. Bona.  Your staging was so beautiful, neighbors and Realtors could not believe it was the same house they saw about a month ago.  You have a gift and it must be shared.  You made this very cluttered home into a most welcoming home without tripping all over "stuff" which shows the true beauty of what a home should be.<br />

			Dear Cristina,<br />
			Thank you so much for your help and the gift given you to stage a home.  The staging helped so very much with showing the homes with light and color and comfort.  I really appreciate what you have done - on all three properties!!!  My clients are also very pleased and had no idea what an improvement to their property your staging would do to help promote their homes.<br />
			Thank you again and hopefully we will do a lot of business together.<br />
